            <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my page! Stating the obvios, my name is Abraham and I was born
                in Valencia, Venezuela. Notice the accent? Yeah, I figured... I moved over to the United States five years ago,
                so I wil describe some of my experiences in both countries. Back in Venezuela I used to be a Political Science/Economics student,
                and here in the United States my experience is mainly in retail management and banking. Technology has always been a passion of mine,
                but I was also interested in pursuing other topics. Now, more than ever, I feel like it is the right time to devote more time and
                resources to the tech field, given all the oportunities and challenges available.</p>
            <p>Coming from a different country myself I have a deep interest in multiculturalism, I love reading about other countries and societies, 
                and geography is also a big passion for me. My main hobby is tennis, I have been playing tennis for almost thirteen years and it has shaped
                who I am as a person.</p>
